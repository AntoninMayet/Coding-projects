# Coding projects

__This place is where I'll developpe my projects of any kind__
I make any thing that can seems interesting whatever this word means. My goal is to take the documentation of something, understand it and make something with. I dont want to look at YouTube video who explains the code and the logic. I want to write it myself.

## QRcode generator

I think the title is self-explanatory

### QRcode V1
This is the proof of concept : the discovery of the lib. I create a basic input/print thing to simply interact with the lib and that's it

### QRcode generator v2

I've created a simple QRcode generator using the two following lib :
- qrcode for the qrcode generation (sound straightforward)
- tkinter for the GUI part

I've also used a piece of software called auto-py-to-exe to ... convert the .py file to a .exe one

### What I would like to do for the QRcode V3

I would like to do an encryption part of my qrcode.
My idea is to encode data with a key, generate a qrcode and share it with the world. The interesting part is that only the people with the encryption key can properly read the qrcode, everyone else will see a weird thing : an encrypted one.

## ASCII converter

I want to write a code that take an standar image and convert every pixel in a ASCII caracter (' .:-=+*#%@') in order to make it cooler.
