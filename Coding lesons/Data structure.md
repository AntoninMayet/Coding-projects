## Course Title: Comprehensive Data Structures in Python

### Course Overview:
This course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of various data structures and their implementations using the Python programming language. Starting with the fundamentals, you will gradually dive into more advanced data structures, exploring their features, applications, and algorithms. Through a combination of theoretical explanations, code examples, and hands-on exercises, you will develop the skills necessary to design and implement efficient data structures in Python.

**Course Duration:** 10 weeks (adjustable based on learning pace)

### Course Outline:

**Week 1: Introduction to Data Structures**

**Week 4: Stacks and Queues**
- Stacks: LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure
- Queues: FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure
- Implementing stacks and queues using arrays and linked lists
- Applications and use cases

**Week 5: Trees**
- Introduction to trees and their properties
- Binary trees: concepts and properties
- Tree traversals: inorder, preorder, and postorder
- Binary search trees (BSTs): insertion, deletion, and searching

**Week 6: Balanced Trees**

- Implementing hash tables in Python

**Week 9: Graphs**
- Introduction to graphs and their representations
- Graph traversals: breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS)
- Graph algorithms: shortest path, minimum spanning tree

**Week 10: Advanced Topics**
- Trie data structure: efficient string storage and retrieval
- Disjoint-set data structure: union-find operations
- Introduction to advanced data structures like B-trees and skip lists
- Review and final project

*Note: Each week can be further divided into individual lessons and exercises, depending on the depth of coverage desired and the learning pace of the students.*

By the end of this course, you will have a strong foundation in data structures and their implementations using Python. You will be equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to choose the appropriate data structure for different problem scenarios and design efficient algorithms.
